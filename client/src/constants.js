    text: `I’m Rose. I’m Violet. And we are identical twins. They said at the same time. We look the same,   said Rose.  We sound the same,   said Violet.  We even dress the same,   they said together as they giggled.
    It’s my birthday, said Rose.  No, it’s my birthday,   said Violet. And both the girls laughed as they yelled,  It’s our birthday.  
    Yes, Violet and Rose were identical. They looked the same, dressed the same, talked the same, acted the same, made the same face when they were happy, did the same frown when they were sad, and they even got the same grades in school.
    Oh! What’s that? They don’t get the same grades in school? I wonder why.  I can tell you why,   their mom said.  Rose is a little more responsible and pays attention to fine details. 
    Violet is a little less responsible and sometimes doesn’t pay attention to things she doesn’t like doing.  
    Come on in, girls,   their mom yelled out the door.  It’s time to open your presents and your dad and I want to see how you like them.   Oh! They were excited. They ran up to the house, up the stairs, through the door,
    and into the hall where they saw two big boxes. Their excitement grew as they wondered what was inside. Then they smiled at one another as they each dashed for a box.  I want this one,   yelled Rose.  No! I want that one,   yelled Violet.
    Girls!   Their mom said.  You know it doesn’t make any difference, they are both the same.  
    Rose and Violet laughed when they realized how silly they had acted. Of course, the presents would be identical, just like them. They each got a box unwrapped, opened, and then looked inside. Rose happily yelled,  Stuff to make a flower garden. This is great, something I always wanted to do. I can grow my own flower garden.  
    Violet said,  I like flowers, and a garden would be nice. But there’s a lot of stuff in this box and it seems like it would be a lot of work.   Violet was right. There was a lot of stuff in the box.
    It contained everything they needed to make a flower garden, everything except water, sunshine, and love. Both girls thanked their mom and dad for the great present and they dragged their heavy boxes outside to start their gardens.
    They each selected a patch of ground to call her own, took the  How To Garden   book from the box, and began to read. Rose said,  Violet, you were right. This is going to be a lot of work.  
    They carefully removed the grass, loosened up the ground, added and mixed in the special flower soil, and planted their flower seeds. Violet found some nice sticks and pretty ribbon to make a fence around her garden. She gave the seeds their first watering and said,  Rose, I am going inside to watch television.  
    Rose asked her Dad to help her make a stone fence around her garden.
    A very special garden needs a very special fence,   she said to him as they gathered and placed the stones. After some time the fence was completed and Rose gave the seeds their first watering.
    Well, maybe later. Right now I want to eat breakfast, and then I think I’ll play a game.   Violet said. Every morning Rose tended her garden and every morning Violet had something else to do. Every morning Rose would remind Violet to water her garden and Violet would reply,  Let Mother Nature take care of it.  
    One morning Rose checked on her garden and she couldn’t believe what she saw. Her garden was covered with little flower plants. She was so excited she danced with joy. Then she looked at Violets garden. It didn’t have many plants, but there were some.
    Rose opened her  How To Garden   book to see what she should do next.  Hmm,   she said to herself.  I must thin the plants. I need to take some out to make room for the others to grow.   Rose felt bad. She loved her flowers and now had to pull some out of the ground. Then she had an idea.
    I’ll plant the ones I pull from my garden into Violets. And that is exactly what she did. Rose then gave both gardens a big drink of water. She loved her garden and there was no reason she shouldn’t love her sister’s equally.
    Their mom watched from the kitchen window. She was very proud of the way Rose was helping her sister. Rose was looking at her garden when she heard Violet coming out the door.  Wow!   Violet said when she saw her garden.  Look at all those plants Rose. I have just as many as you. Our gardens are really growing.    Violet,   Rose said.  Do you know that I …   And she stopped talking for a second, as she was angry. She continued.  Do you know that I think our gardens are growing equally?  
    I think so too,   Violet replied.  And from now on I’m going to tend my garden every day, just like you.   Over the next several weeks they watered their gardens, pulled the unwanted weeds and grass, fed the plants, and even got some worms to put in their gardens to keep the soil loose. Just like the  How To Garden   book recommended. They were pleased. The plants were growing and many had buds that we re ready to open.
    Oh! It wouldn’t be long now. It wouldn’t be long before there were two beautiful flower gardens. The girls were so excited. They just couldn’t wait to see all the colorful flowers. The next morning they got dressed and hurried outside to tend their gardens. To their surprise, they were in full bloom. They shrieked with excitement, held hands, and danced in circles. The flowers were so beautiful.
    Every color in the rainbow was in their gardens.
    We have a surprise for you! You are going to have a baby brother soon. And your dad and I know you will take care of him as well as you take care of your gardens. Aren’t you girls excited?   Rose and Violet just stood there. They didn’t know what to say. All these years they were a family of four, and now there was going to be a strange fifth member. Another member that would need his parent’s love. Love that should be theirs, and they did not know if they wanted to share.
    What’s wrong, girls?   their dad asked.  Your mom and I thought you would be happy and excited. Let’s have a glass of milk and maybe a cookie or two. Then you can tell us why the frowns.   As all four were licking the center from their cream filled cookie, Violet spoke up.  You are going to love me less because you are going to have to give him love.    I feel the same way,   said Rose.  I don’t want you to love me less.  
      My goodness,   their mom said.  We could never love either of you less. Where did you get that idea?    It’s not an idea,   Rose said.  There are two of us and two pieces of love, one from you, and one from dad. When there are three of us, you’re both going to take some of that love away from us, and give it to him.  
    Oh, girls.   Their dad said.  Love isn’t shared. Love is magical and it grows.
    Why each day your mom and I love you more than the day before, and tomorrow we will love you more than we do today.   Rose, do you remember the morning you went out to your garden to thin the plants?   she asked.  And how you saw that Violets garden had just a few?    And do you remember what you did?   Rose thought for a minute then said.  Yes, I remember taking my flower plants and putting them in Violet’s garden so she would think her garden was doing as well as mine.   Violet just looked at her sister.
    Her mom then asked.  Why did you do that?    Well,   said Rose.  I love the plants and I love my sister so I thought I would share the plants with her.  
    Ah,   said her mom.  Share the plants. That must mean that you loved your plants less because you gave some to Violet.   Rose thought about what her mom had said, then replied.  No, I didn’t love my plants any less.  
    I loved them the same and I loved the ones in Violet’s garden, and I loved doing something nice for her, and I loved watching both gardens grow, and I love the flowers in both gardens, and I love you. Now I understand how magical love is, and how it grows.    Me too,   said Violet.  Let’s go out and smell the flowers.    I’d love to,   said Rose.`,

    text: `Once upon a time, there lived a monkey who had no home of his own. They called him ‘Springs’, for he always walked with a bounce in his step
    He had sold everything he owned, and with that money, he had started traveling the world.
    He wanted to see the world’s smallest and biggest wonders. He traveled from village to village, town to town,
    and offered his services- to do work in exchange for food and shelter.
    He was a happy monkey and he loved helping people.
    One day, he passed through the village of Zver, where twenty animals lived. He saw an old beaver. so he walked towards him and said “Hello, Mr. beaver. If I was to do some garden work for you today, would you be so kind as to give me something to eat.”
    The old beaver agreed and asked Springs to do some gardening and fix up a few things around the house. It was a long and tiring day for Springs but enjoyed his day. 
    When springs returned to the house in the evening, the whole village had gathered there. There was a lot of food put out on the large wooden table and everybody was celebrating as though a hero had come to their small village.
    They all had a great time that night; it was like a big party. There was dancing and lots food and Springs really enjoyed his evening.
    The following morning when Springs was ready to leave, the old beaver approached Springs with tears in his eyes and said, “Thank you for joining us for dinner. Please come back whenever you have time. I have two boys around your age who I have not seen in 10 years. Spending time with you reminded me of my boys.”
    Springs did not know what to say so he just hugged the Beaver, just like he would his father, and set off on his way with a promise to return one day.
    Springs had been walking for some time and was tired.
    He saw two highway robbers who pushed him down and took his bag away. 
    When the robbers looked in his bag they only found a rope, some tools, and some bread. 
    They threw his bag on the ground and ran away. Springs picked up his backpack and continued on his journey.
    He started to think about all the good and bad in the world. 
    The road was long and winding and finally led him to a dark forest. The only way he could continue his journey was to walk through the forest. 
    Springs walked for more than an hour and then he realised he was lost. He decided to climb up a tree to relax and eat some of the bread the villagers had given him. Suddenly Springs heard some voices shouting for help.
    He climbed down from the tree and ran in the direction the voices were coming from. Springs reached the place the voices were coming from.
    Springs reached the place the voices were coming from. He saw that the two robbers who had pushed him earlier that day were trapped inside a deep hole in the ground. 
    They were both trapped and couldn’t get out, and were yelling for help.
    Springs quickly reached into his backpack and grabbed the rope that was inside. He tied one end of the rope to a tree and threw the other end inside the hole. The robbers both quickly climbed up the rope to safety.
    The robbers were amazed that Springs had saved them. One robber asked “Why did you help us? We pushed you and tried to rob you earlier!”.
    Springs replied “There are good people and bad people in this world. The good people do good things and bad people do bad things. I have decided to be one of the good people.” The two robbers were amazed by Springs’ reply.
    Springs told the robbers, “I have traveled far and wide, seen happiness as well as sorrow. I have met all kinds of people; good, bad, old, and young. I have experienced all sorts of bad things, but I have always tried to do only good things.”
    As Springs was leaving, he gave the two robbers some bread with a smile and said, “I hope what I have said today will help you realize that there is always a way to live without causing harm to others.”`,

    text: `“Hi! My name is Samantha and I want to be a scientist. You may be wondering why and my answer is simple. I am amazed at all the wonderful things like television, cellular phones, men on the Moon, space exploration, and the list goes on. But those are big things and I just don’t understand everything about them yet. I also wonder about smaller things like-why do my doll’s eyes close when I lay her down and open when I pick her up. Or how are cartoons made? Hmm – I know it has something to do with Science. My brother Samuel wants to be a scientist too, but he likes things that I don’t, like-why Stalactites grow.
    But even though we don’t like the same things it’s still Science so we get along just fine. In fact, our teachers help us better understand Math, technology, current events and trends - all of which are important. We even help each other and have lots of fun.
    I like to experiment or take things apart to see how they work. No matter what I do, I tell my mom or dad what I am going to be doing and sometimes even ask for their help. I would never just do something. I could get hurt.  Sometimes it’s best to start small, and that’s just what I did. I remember my first experiment in detail and it was a lot of fun to do. I had to do an optical illusion. You may be wondering why that is important and all I can say is that it’s the basis for making
    cartoons - and here is why. Our brains fill in the gaps for whatever our eyes aren’t processing. So two different pictures can actually become one or still images can appear to be moving.Try this experiment, it’s lots of fun and there is nothing dangerous about it. Here is what you need:
    • 2 small pieces of white cardboard or index cards.  • Tape  • A pencil to be used as a shaft • Crayons, colored pencils or whatever you want to draw with
    The Experiment Preparation: • Draw a large birdcage on one piece of cardboard. You are the scientist so make it look like you want. Just make it pretty big.
    • On the other piece of cardboard draw a bird. Maybe a Budgie or a Toucan. Just make sure it is  smaller than the birdcage.
    free childrens books
    • Tape the pictures, back-to-back, onto the pencil shaft. The Expected Result:
    • What do you think is going to happen if you spin the pencil? I can’t tell you because I did it and this is your discovery.
    The Experiment: • Hold the pencil between the palms of your hands. • Rub your hands to make the picture spin around. • Of course, you have to look at the picture while it’s spinning.The Experiment Result:• You should have seen the two pictures appear as one. If you didn’t see the bird in the cage, keep
    trying until you do.
    That is Science! Have some fun and try different pictures.(I even put Samuel in jail once). Hey, do you want to do a little magic and make a spot on a piece of paper disappear? It’s different for each person but it does disappear. Yes, it’s Science too but let’s get to the experiment and I’ll explain the Science later.
    It’s simple to set-up. Just draw a square about ¼ inch to one side of a white piece of paper and color it in. Draw a circle about 3 to 4 inches to the right that’s about the same size as the square and color it in. This is the dot you are going to make disappear. Actually you can draw two small pictures, or letters, or numbers, or whatever you want. One of them will disappear.
    • After you draw them hold the paper at arm’s length.
    • Close your left eye and focus on the square with your right eye.
    • Slowly move the paper towards you.
    • At some point the dot will disappear.
    • Try it again and make the square disappear.
    Close your right eye and focus on the dot with
    your left eye. Move the paper towards
    you until the square disappears.
    It’s magic! Well, actually it is Science. You see, the spot where your optic nerve connects to your eye doesn’t have any photoreceptors. That means it is a blind spot and we all have them.
    You never notice this blind spot because your two eyes work together to cover it up. Just like in the first experiment your brain fills in for the blind spot with the background.
    I have a question for you. What do you think will happen if you use a colored piece of paper like red?
    If you don’t know, do another experiment and see for yourself.
    Science is fun and I am glad I am going to be a scientist.
    Maybe you’ll decide to be one too.”`,

    text: `“Hi! My name is Samuel and I want to be a scientist. You may be wondering why and my answer is simple. I am amazed at all the wonderful things like rockets to the Moon, fire trucks pumping out all that water, fast race cars, space ships, and the list goes on. But those are big things and I just don’t understand everything about them yet.
    I also wonder about small things like-how does sugar turn into crystals called rock candy? Or how are those rock formations in caves made? Hmm – I know it has something to do with Science.
    My sister Samantha wants to be a scientist too, but she likes things that I don’t-like why her dolls eyes open and close. But even though we don’t like the same things, it’s still Science so we get along just fine. In fact, our teachers help us better understand Math,

    I like to experiment or take things apart to see how they work. No matter what I do, I tell my mom or dad what I am going to be doing and sometimes even ask for their help. I would never just do something – I could get hurt.
    Sometimes it’s best to start small, that’s what I did. I remember my first experiment in detail and it was a lot of fun to do. It had to do with growing small crystals, much like the way rock candy is made. You may be wondering why that is important and all I can say is that it’s the basis for making any type of crystal. Their shape and size depends on many things and the more you read about them, the more you experiment, the more you grow interesting crystals.
    Try this experiment; I call it The Crystal Bowl. It’s lots of fun and there is nothing dangerous about it. Because I am using a common chemical I let my mom know what I am doing.
    Here is what you need:
    • A small clear bowl to grow the crystals in
    • Epsom salt (a common chemical)
    • Food coloring
    • A measuring cup
    The Experiment :In the clear bowl, stir ½ cup of Epsom salts with ½ cup of very hot tap water. The hotter, the better.
    Stir for at least 1 minute. You will be making a saturated solution (scientific talk)-meaning that the water cannot hold any more of the Epsom salts. Some undissolved salt crystals will be at the bottom of the bowl.
    Add a couple of drops of your favorite food coloring. I like red.
    Place the bowl in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours. I put a sign on the bowl – Samantha-Do Not Eat! (I’m so funny.)
    Take out your bowl of crystals and pour out the extra water that may be at the bottom. Have fun examining them.
    Okay, it’s time to get Scientific. What just happened? You just made Magnesium sulfate crystals. Magnesium sulfate is the actual name for Epsom salt.
    The temperature of the water determines just how much Magnesium sulfate it can hold. The hotter the water, the more it can hold, and the more crystals it can grow.
    So why did we put it in the refrigerator? By rapidly cooling the water we forced fast crystal growth. The quickly cooling water became denser and made the Magnesium sulfate atoms run into each other joining together into crystal structures.
    When you grow crystals this way they will be small, thin, and a lot of them. If you let the water evaporate slowly you will get different crystals. You will have to experiment to see the results.
    That is Science! Oh, don’t forget to clean up any mess and ask your mom or dad to really clean anything you might reuse.
    Have you ever seen those really neat formations in a cave? They are commonly called stalactites (they grow from the top of the cave down) and stalagmites (that grow from the cave floor up).
    Want to make some? I’ll bet you do!
    Again there is nothing dangerous, but let your mom or dad know what you are doing. This experiment takes some time and could get a little messy.
    Here is what you need:
    • Two glass jars
    • A large plate or pan
    • Baking soda
    • String
    • Paper clips
    • Water
    The Experiment : Fill the two jars with hot water. The hotter, the better.
    Stir in as much baking soda as will dissolve in the water. Mix it up well and make that saturated solution.
    Cut the string so it can go close to the bottom of the jars and go between them when they are several inches apart. Then tie a paper clip to each end to act as weights.
    Put one end of the weighted string into each of the jars.
    Place the jars on the large plate or pan, making sure the string has a little dip in the center. The plate or pan is needed to catch the drips of your scientific solution.
    Put your experiment in a safe place for 3 to 4 weeks. Keep an eye on it and watch your formation grow.
    What has happened? The saturated solution is carried through the string. This process is called capillary action.
    When it gets to the dip in the string it drips onto the plate or pan. It is similar to water passing through the ground, picking up minerals, and falling through a cave. Over time the dripping water evaporates and creates stalactites and stalagmites.
    It’s magic! Well, actually it is Science and takes place all over the world.
    Science is fun and I am glad I am going to be a scientist.Maybe you’ll decide to be one too.”`,

    I caught a fish, my eyes were gleaming.
    When I got it to the boat.
    We were amazed to see.
    The biggest fish in the lake was caught by me!`,

    text: `Hi! My name is Mathew. That’s Math_ _ as is mathematics and _ _ _ _ ew as in you are going to learn some multiplication tricks.
    Before I share the new tricks let’s just review some other things to remember when multiplying.
    Remember 0 times anything is always equal to 0.
    2 X 0 = 0
    Now it’s your turn, quick! What is 4 X 0?
    That’s right it’s 0, good job
    Remember 1 times anything is always equal to the “anything.”
    1 X 6 = 6
    Now it’s your turn, quick! What is 1 X 9?
    Great work, you are correct it’s 9.
    And of course you remember that 10 times anything is the “anything” with a 0 added at the end.
    10 X 3 = 30
    What is 10 X 5?
    That’s right. It is 50.
    Now here is a trick you can use to help you with the Times 9 multiplication table for 9 x 0 through 9 x 10.
    First write down the table:
    9 X 0 =
    9 X 1 =
    9 X 2 =
    9 X 3 =
    9 X 4 =
    9 X 5 =
    9 X 6 =
    9 X 7 =
    9 X 8 =
    9 X 9 =
    10 X 9 =
    Next complete the table with the easy answers for Times 0, 1, and 10.
    9 X 0 = 0 (0 times anything always equals 0).
    9 X 1 = 9 (1 times anything always equals the anything).
    9 X 2 =
    9 X 3 =
    9 X 4 =
    9 X 5 =
    9 X 6 =
    9 X 7 =
    9 X 8 =
    9 X 9 =
    10 X 9 = 90 (10 times anything equals the anything with 0 added to the end).
    Simple enough, right?
    Next, pretend you don’t know the answers to 9 X 2 through 9 X 9 and starting at the top (9 X 2) write the numbers 1 through 8 next to each.
    9 X 0 = 0
    9 X 1 = 9
    9 X 2 = 1
    9 X 3 = 2
    9 X 4 = 3
    9 X 5 = 4
    9 X 6 = 5
    9 X 7 = 6
    9 X 8 = 7
    9 X 9 = 8
    10 X 9 = 90
    That was easy. Now do the same thing but start at the bottom (9 x 9).
    9 X 0 = 0
    9 X 1 = 9
    9 X 2 = 18
    9 X 3 = 27
    9 X 4 = 36
    9 X 5 = 45
    9 X 6 = 54
    9 X 7 = 63
    9 X 8 = 72
    9 X 9 = 81
    10 X 9 = 90
    Success! You can easily write down the Times 9 multiplication table for 0 through 10.
    Times 11 everybody. Yes, that is what I said.
    TIMES 11, it’s SCARY!
    Or is it?
    First, look at 1-digit numbers multiplied by 11.
    It is much like multiplying by 1 except there are two places in the answer. (One times anything is anything – or in this case anything-anything).
    11 X 0 = 0 (Remember, 0 times anything is always 0).
    11 X 1 = 11
    11 X 2 = 22
    11 X 3 = 33
    11 X 4 = 44
    11 X 5 = 55
    11 X 6 = 66
    11 X 7 = 77
    11 X 8 = 88
    11 X 9 = 99
    Wow! That was easy.
    But can you easily multiply 2-digit numbers by 11?
    Yes – And here is the trick!
    These are big numbers but don’t get scared.
    Let’s look at 11 X 15.
    Take the number you want to multiply by 11 (in this case 15) and imagine a space between the 2-digits.
    1 _ 5
    Now add the two numbers together.
    1 + 5 = 6
    If the answer is a single-digit (1, 2, 3, etc.) put the sum in the space to get your answer.
    165
    So … 11 X 15 = 165
    Go ahead and try a few.
    11 X 12 =
    The answer equals 1 (1+2) 2 or 132.
    11 X 26 =
    The answer equals 2 (2+6) 6 or 286.
    11 X 81 =
    The answer equals 8 (8+1) 1 or 891.
    You didn’t know you were so smart, did you.
    Oh-oh … What do you do if the numbers in the space add up to a two-digit number like 10 or 17?
    Well it’s a little tricky … But not hard.
    Let’s take a look at 11 X 77.
    Imagine that space between the 7 and 7.
    7 _ 7
    Add the two numbers together (7+7=14)
    Put the second number into the space (in this case it is 4)
    747
    Then add the number 1 to the first number.
    (7+1)47 … or
    Let’s do a little more practice.
    The challenge: 11 X 29 =?
    2 _ 9
    2 (2+9) 9
    2 (11) 9
    Keep the second space number in the space and add 1 to the first number.
    (2+1)19
    319
    So … 11 X 29 = 319
    Let’s do another great big one just for fun.
    11 X 98 =?
    9 _ 8
    9 (9+8) 8
    9(17)8
    Keep the second space number in the space and add 1 to the first number.
    (9+1)78
    1078
    So … 11 X 98 = 1078`,

    I know I don’t look like a regular cat.
    It’s not because I’m skinny, and not because I’m fat.
    It is because my owner makes me a pretty cat.
    From dressing me in costumes
    and flowery hats
    to painting my nails. Can you imagine that!
    She always treats me tenderly,
    and feeds me twice a day.
    Miss Molly is never too busy to sit by me and play.
    She makes my pretty costumes from old dolls’ clothes and such.
    I never know what I’ll be wearing, but I know it will cause a fuss.
    Miss Molly is my favorite person,
    and as she grows and grows,
    I hope she will always be my friend,
    and make me all my clothes.
    Purr! I mean.

    text: `Sophia was excited. She was now in the 2nd grade and it was her first day of school.
    As she finished her breakfast, she looked out of the window and saw all her friends waiting for the bus.
    “Mommy, can I ride the bus?” she asked. “Yes,” mommy said.Sophia was even more excited.
    She jumped up from the table to go to the bus stop. Then her Mommy said, “Yes, you can ride the bus next week but I’ll walk with you to school for the first week.” Sophia was sad and confused. She thought her Mommy said she could ride the bus but then kind of changed the answer.
    Sophia wondered why her Mommy just didn’t say “no”.  At least then she wouldn’t have gotten so excited. “Oh well,” Sophia sighed. “Let’s go, it is a long walk.”
    Several days later, the music teacher talked with Sophia’s class.
    She explained about all the instruments and had the 3rd graders demonstrate each of them.
    Sophia heard the flute and thought that it made the prettiest sound she had ever heard. “Can I play the flute?” Sophia asked. “Well, that depends,” replied the music teacher. “First, you need to get your parents’ permission, and then join the band. You also need to know that learning to play the flute, or any instrument, takes a lot of hard work.
    Now, if you are willing to put in the work and you parents let you join the band, then the answer is YES. And I would be happy to have you join. We need another good flutist.” Sophia was so excited and couldn’t wait to ask her mommy.
    School was over and as Sophia walked out of the door, she saw her mommy waiting. She ran down the sidewalk, yelling out “I want to play the flute. Can I play the flute? I want to join the band.”
    “Calm down, Sophia.” her mommy said. Sophia took a deep breath, counted to three, and said, “Can I please play the flute in the school band?”
    “Yes, of course you can,” her Mommy replied.              
    Oh, Sophia was so very happy. She had gotten permission and was now going to play the flute in the band.
    Her Mommy then said, “Yes, you can play an instrument just like I did.
    The tuba is a great instrument and you can even have mine. The same one I used when I was in band.”
    Oh, poor Sophia, she was so sad. She wanted to play the flute, not the tuba.
    Sophia just didn’t understand why her Mommy said “yes” when she asked but really meant “no”. At least “no” for the instrument Sophia really wanted to play.
    “Maybe I won’t join the band,” Sophia said in a low, sad voice. “Well, that’s up to you,” her Mommy replied.
    As Sophia finished her breakfast, she looked out the window and saw all her friends waiting for the bus. She was so very excited. This was a special day.
    The week was up and she could ride the bus with all her friends. She squirmed in her chair as she gulped down the last mouthful of milk.
    “Bye mommy!” she squealed as she ran towards the door. “And if I can’t ride the bus, please say NO. It is easier for me to understand.”`,
